# QC-Mentorship-program_Task1
This Note book is a soluation for task1 of QOSF Mentorship program.
This soluation use the grover's algorithm to return a quantum state of adjacent bits which always have different values for any number of qubits depending on the list input from the user.
This solution will be updated to return  a quantum state which is a superposition of indices of the target solution, obtaining in the output the indices of the inputs where two adjacent bits will always have different values.
